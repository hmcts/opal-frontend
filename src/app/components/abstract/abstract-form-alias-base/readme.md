## Installation

To use the `AbstractFormAliasBase` in your project, ensure that it is extended or used as a base for form-related components within your Angular application.

```typescript
import { AbstractFormAliasBase } from '@components/abstract/abstract-form-alias-base/abstract-form-alias-base';
```

## Usage

This component is intended to be used as a base class for form components. You can extend this class to create a form that manages alias-based controls.

```typescript
export class MyFormComponent extends AbstractFormAliasBase {
  // Extend the functionality with specific form logic
}
```

### Example Usage:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { AbstractFormAliasBase } from '@components/abstract/abstract-form-alias-base/abstract-form-alias-base';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-form',
  templateUrl: './my-form.component.html',
})
export class MyFormComponent extends AbstractFormAliasBase {
  // Add specific form controls and functionality
}
```

## Inputs

Since `AbstractFormAliasBase` is an abstract class, the actual inputs will depend on how the class is extended. Typically, this class works with alias controls that are defined in the child components that extend it.

| Input       | Type          | Description                                           |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `aliasForm` | `FormGroup`   | The form group managing alias controls.               |

## Methods

`AbstractFormAliasBase` provides common methods that are useful for handling alias-based form logic. Some common methods include:

- **`initializeForm()`**: Initializes the form controls.
- **`getControlAlias()`**: Retrieves alias controls from the form.
- **`isValid()`**: Checks if the form is valid.
  
Example:

```typescript
this.initializeForm();
const alias = this.getControlAlias('aliasField');
if (this.isValid()) {
  // Proceed with valid form actions
}
```

## Testing

Unit tests for this component can be found in the `abstract-form-alias-base.spec.ts` file. To run the tests, use:

```bash
ng test
```
