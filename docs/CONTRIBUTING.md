## Commit and Pull Request Guidelines

- Follow Conventional Commits, optionally prefixed with Jira keys (e.g., `PO-716`); keep subjects at or below 72 characters.
- Reference the Jira ticket and linked PR (e.g., `(#1828)`) in subject or body.
- Include a concise summary, testing evidence, and updated checklists in PRs; attach Cypress artifacts when debugging flakes.

## Pull Request Template

Use this template for PR descriptions:

```md
### Jira link

<!--
Replace PROJ-XXXXXX with your Jira key
Remove this section if its not applicable, or replace it with another reference link
-->

See [PROJ-XXXXXX](JIRA_LINK)

### Change description

<!--
Provide a description of what change you are proposing.
A short summary here and then you can add comments in your pull request explaining your change to others.
-->

### Testing done

<!-- Comment:
Provide a clear description of how this change was tested.
At minimum this should include proof that a computer has executed the changed lines.
Ideally this should include an automated test or an explanation as to why this change has no tests.
Note that automated test coverage is not always complete, so a successful pull request build does not necessarily imply that a computer has executed the changed lines.
If automated test coverage does not exist for the lines you are changing, you must describe the scenario(s) in which you manually tested the change.
For frontend changes, include screenshots of the relevant page(s) before and after the change.
For refactoring and code cleanup changes, exercise the code before and after the change and verify the behaviour remains the same.
