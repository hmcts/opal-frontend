# Contributing

## Commit and Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow Conventional Commits, optionally prefixed with Jira keys (e.g., `PO-716`); keep subjects at or below 72 characters.
- Reference the Jira ticket and linked PR (e.g., `(#1828)`) in subject or body.
- Include a concise summary, testing evidence, and updated checklists in PRs; attach Cypress artifacts when debugging flakes.
