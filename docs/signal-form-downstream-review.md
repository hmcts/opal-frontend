# Downstream Impact Review

## Store Interactions

- `FinesMacStore.setAccountCommentsNotes` continues to accept `IFinesMacAccountCommentsNotesForm` instances without modification; emitted form data from the signal base preserves the original shape (`formData` + `nestedFlow`).
- Computed helpers (`accountCommentsNotesStatus`, mandatory section checks) operate on `formData` values only, so no additional adjustments are required for the signal-backed form.

## Related Consumers

- Payment terms, fixed penalty details, and review account components rely on the store contract rather than direct form controls. No adapters are necessary while the state shape remains unchanged.
- Payload mappers/builders already consume the stored `formData`; manual validation confirmed field names are untouched, so existing transformations remain valid.

## Next Steps (For Awareness)

- When additional forms migrate to the signal base, review aggregated validation utilities to ensure consistent error summary messaging.
- Tests covering downstream flows will be updated separately as per the agreed scope.
